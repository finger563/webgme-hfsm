WebGME App for creating Executable Hierarchical Finite State Machines
(HFSMs). Contains metamodel, visualization, simulation, and code
generation for Hierarchical Finite State Machines (HFSMs) following
the UML State Machine specification, see [Wikipedia UML State Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine), [another reference](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/state-machine-diagrams.html), and [the UML specification](http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/).

## Description

This repository contains the plugins, decorators, and visualizers (all
of which are WebGME Components) and the base and example seeds for
creating HFSMs with embedded c/c++ code in each state. The WebGME app
utilizes the [CodeEditor](https://github.com/finger563/webgme-codeeditor) to allow users to edit the code for the
model as if it were part of an IDE.

Together these components and (meta-)modeling environment make up the
*State Machine Domain* for WebGME.

The [Base seed](./src/seeds/base.webgmex) contains just the `Meta`
definitions for the projects and HFSMs following the UML State Diagram
specification and the [Examples Seed](./src/seeds/examples.webgmex)
contains a project with three different HFSMs: *simple*, *medium*, and
*complex*.

HFSMs are trees, where a state may have zero or more substates.
 
In this modeling paradigm, `Projects` can contain any number of `State
Machines`.

State Machines have the following attributes:

* `Includes` : include statements for the HFSM, will be at the top of
  the generated header
* `Initialization` : intialization code run at the beginning of the
  HFSM, before any of the state initialization code.
* `Declarations` : variable/function/class declarations within the
  HFSM's `StateMachine` namespace, will be within the generated header
  file
* `Definitions` : variable/function/class definitions within the
  HFSM's `StateMachine` namespace, will be within the generated source
  file
  
## Getting Started

### Setting up the WebGME-HFSM Server

#### Docker

Build the dockerfile for the webgme-hfsm docker image

``` bash
docker build -t webgme-hfsm .
```

Now run the mongodb docker and the webgme-hfsm docker

``` bash
docker run --name mongo -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
docker run --name webgme-hfsm -d -p 8081:8081 --link mongo:mongo webgme-hfsm:latest
```

You can also use docker-compose:

``` bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Native

Dependencies:
* [nodejs ^6.0](https://www.nodejs.org)
* [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/finger563/webgme-hfsm
cd webgme-hfsm
npm install -g bower # needed for extra package management
npm install          # installs the required packages for webgme-hfsm
npm start
```

Which will run the WebGME-HFSM server on **PORT 8081** of your local
machine, accepting connections on all IP addresses available to it.

Note: this requires a mongodb instance running on the machine, which
can be started with:

```bash
mongod --dbpath ${path you want for your database}
```

Once the server has been started, you can navigate (in *Chrome*) to 

```
localhost:8081
```

where the server is running. Create a WebGME project there from either
the `base` or the `examples` seed.

### Creating a HFSM

Once a webgme project has been opened, creat a new HFSM project by dragging in a new component from the left panel.

![Creating a new HFSM project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/finger563/webgme-hfsm/images/new_hfsm_project.gif)

Double click on the project and then drag in a new HFSM component.

![Creating a new HFSM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/finger563/webgme-hfsm/images/new_hfsm.gif)

In addition to editing the HFSM through webgme, the HFSMViz can also be used. Open an HFSM and click on the HFSMViz on the left side of the screen to use this mode.

Components can be dragged into the visualizer just like in webgme, with addditional operations accessible via the right-click context menu

### Simulating a HFSM

In the HFSMViz, the active state of the simulation is highlighted in
red, and the user can press the event buttons to see how the state
machine will react to that event. If any guards need to be evaluated,
a modal dialog will pop up with options for the user to select which
guard should evaluate to true at that time. The user has the option of
canceling the transition by selecting `None`. In the case that the
guards are associated with exit transitions of a choice pseudostate,
the `Default Transition` will be shown as a guard choice with no text.

![Complex state machine simulation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/finger563/webgme-hfsm/images/simulation.gif)

The **HFSMViz** visualizer allows the visualization of the full
HFSM. It also provides:
* An interface to see which events will be handled by the HFSM when it
  is in a selected (or active) state
* *Simulation* of the HFSM which properly traverses the transitions from
  the currently active state to the next active state when the user
  spawns an event into the simulation.
  * The visualization will even pop up dialogs asking the user which
    guard condition should be evalutated to true when the HFSM passes
    through a choice pseudostate or when multiple transitions have the
    same event trigger and different guards.
* Drag and drop external transition creation between two nodes of the
  HFSM
* *Automatic layout* and routing of the edges and nodes of the HFSM
  tree
* *Context menu* allowing the user to: 
  * Toggle the display of a state's children
  * Set the active state
  * Auto-arrange selected nodes into a grid
  * Re-parent selected nodes into the right-clicked node
  * Add a new element (which can also be done by dragging from the
    `Part Browser` and dropping onto the visualizer.)

### Code Generation

The **SoftwareGenerator** plugin supports generation of a `Project`
and it's `State Machines` into executable code, with the option of
generating test-bench code for interactively testing out the generated
HFSM and tracing through which actions occur in what order when an
event is spawned.

You can edit the code attributes for the `State Machines`, `States`,
`Internal Transitions`, and `External Transitions` within the
CodeEditor visualizer.

#### Test Bench Code

When the test code is generated, it generates a `Makefile` which
builds a `test` and `DEBUG` target for each of the `State Machines` in
the `Project` from which the plugin was executed. These test bench
codes compile in (using a preprocessor define `DEBUG_OUTPUT`) logging
code which traces when transitions are fired, which guards are true,
which actions are executed, and which events are in the State
Machine's event queue.
